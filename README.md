Week 2 Challenge, VBA-challenge
VBA code includes worksheet iterator and last row finder. Checks for tickers across all multiple worksheets and returns various values.

While exporting the VBA script it saved as a .bas, I changed the extension to .vbs for consistency with the module. The code within are exactly the same, but I'll upload both for safety.
